/* Personal investment — scaffolded ahead of the tool that will live here.
 *
 * Deliberately carries NO rates or thresholds. AIBN advises on the TAX of an
 * investment, not on the investment itself, and the fund/exit-tax regime is
 * mid-change, so every figure on this page would need a review cycle it does
 * not have yet. Where a number is genuinely needed the page links to the
 * calculator that already owns it (CGT, CAT) rather than restating it here.
 * When the planned calculator lands, follow the DB-first-with-code-fallback
 * pattern in AGENTS.md — do not hardcode rates into this page. */

   treatment, which is the point: the wrapper decides the tax, not the asset. */

  {
    title: "Shares held directly",
    body: "Gains on disposal fall under capital gains tax, with your annual personal exemption and any allowable losses set against them first. Dividends are income, taxed at your marginal rate, with withholding tax credited against the bill.",
  },

    title: "Funds and ETFs",
    body: "Irish and EU funds sit outside the CGT rules entirely. They carry their own exit tax, charged on a disposal and again on a deemed disposal every eight years even if you have sold nothing — the single most common surprise we see.",
  },
  {
    title: "Deposit interest",
    body: "Interest from Irish deposit accounts is taxed at source. Interest from an account held abroad is not, so it has to be declared, and that is where most non-compliance starts.",
  },
  {
    title: "Rental income",
    body: "Rent is assessed as income after allowable expenses, mortgage interest and capital allowances on fittings. A later sale of the property is a separate capital gains event.",
  },
  {
    title: "Pensions and approved schemes",
    body: "Contributions attract relief at your marginal rate within age-related limits, and the fund grows free of Irish tax until it is drawn down. For most people this is the first place a euro of investable income should go.",
  },
  {
    title: "Gifts, inheritance and transfers",

    step: "02",
    title: "Separate income from gains",
    body: "Dividends, interest and rent are taxed as they arise. Gains are taxed when you dispose. They have different rates, different deadlines and different forms, and mixing them up is what triggers most Revenue correspondence.",
  },
  {
    step: "03",
    title: "Apply reliefs and losses",
    body: "Annual exemptions, carried-forward losses, relief on retirement or transfer of a business, and the credits already withheld at source. These are claimed, not applied automatically.",
