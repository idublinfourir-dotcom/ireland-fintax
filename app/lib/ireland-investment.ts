/* ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   Ireland investment options engine.
   Pure functions + a static option snapshot: no React, no I/O, so the UI
   (ireland-investment-planner.tsx) and the tests share one auditable source.

   The data is the "Options Comparison" tab of the €500,000 research workbook
   (prepared 28 August 2026), reproduced field for field: sector, risk band,
   gross return range, tax treatment, effective tax rate, liquidity, minimum
   and cap. Every figure is sourced — see SOURCES at the foot of this file.

   Two things this deliberately is NOT:
   - It is not advice. It compares the Irish TAX TREATMENT and net return of
     option types. It does not know the user's circumstances and must never be
     presented as a personal recommendation.
   - It is not a forecast. Deposit, State Savings and bond yields are
     contractual and quoted as such. Everything else is a long-run illustrative
     RANGE, and real outcomes can be negative.

   Rates move (State Savings changed on 30 Aug 2026, exit tax fell to 38% on
   1 Jan 2026). Update DATA_AS_OF whenever a figure below changes.
